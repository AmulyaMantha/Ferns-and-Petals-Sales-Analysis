Key Performance Highlights

These figures highlight a strong revenue base with a moderate order volume and relatively high ticket size per order. However, the delivery timeline indicates potential improvement areas in logistics efficiency.

Revenue Insights

By Occasion

Highest revenue generated from Anniversary orders, followed by All Occasions, Raksha Bandhan, Diwali, and Birthday.

Valentine’s Day and Holi contributed lower revenue comparatively, signaling an opportunity to boost marketing during these periods.

By Category

Flowers contributed the largest revenue share, followed by Soft Toys, Sweets, Cake, and Raksha Bandhan hampers.

Non-core categories such as Mugs and Plants generated minimal revenue.

By Product

Revenue was evenly distributed across premium gift sets like Deserunt Box, Hasmuk Pack, Dolorosa Gift, Quaid Gift, and Magnam Set, each contributing significantly (~₹10–12 lakhs range).

By City

Major contributions came from Kavali (26%) and Dharabad (23%), followed by North Dumdum (19%) and Haridwar (17%).

Imphal (16%) also showed a steady share, suggesting diverse regional penetration.

Sales Trends

Monthly Trends

Strongest months: January and August, each showing a revenue spike (likely driven by festivals and seasonal demand).

Weakest months: February–March and September–October, reflecting off-peak seasons.

Hourly Trends (Order Time)

Peak sales occurred during evening hours (7 PM – 9 PM), when customers are more likely to place personal/festive orders.

Midday and late-night orders were comparatively lower.

Operational Insight

The average delivery period of 5.53 days suggests the need for logistics optimization. With gifting being a time-sensitive category (birthdays, anniversaries, festivals), reducing delivery timelines could significantly improve customer satisfaction and repeat purchases.

Strategic Recommendations

Seasonal Marketing Campaigns

Increase promotional focus during low-demand months (Feb–March, Sept–Oct) to balance revenue cycles.

Enhance Valentine’s Day campaigns, as this is a major gifting occasion but currently underperforming.

Product Mix Optimization

Expand offerings in high-performing categories like Flowers, Soft Toys, and Sweets.

Reevaluate underperforming categories (Mugs, Plants) to either reposition them or reduce focus.

City-Level Expansion

Focus on strengthening supply chains in top-performing cities (Kavali, Dharabad) while running targeted campaigns in lower-contributing regions (Imphal, Haridwar) to unlock potential growth.

Operational Efficiency

Invest in faster delivery mechanisms and regional warehouses to reduce the 5.53-day average delivery time.

Customer Engagement

Leverage evening peak order times (7–9 PM) with flash sales, limited-time offers, and app notifications to maximize conversion.

Conclusion

The analysis reveals that Ferns and Petals has a solid revenue base with strong performance during key festivals and occasions, led by categories such as Flowers and premium gift hampers. However, improving delivery timelines, optimizing underperforming categories, and enhancing targeted seasonal campaigns can significantly boost overall growth, customer satisfaction, and market share.
